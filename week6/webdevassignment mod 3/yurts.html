        roof dome that can be opened.</p>

    <h3><strong> How are the yurts furnished?</strong></h3>
    <p> Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and
        gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity
        and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom
        facilities are located in the lodge.</p>

        <section>
    <h3><strong>What should I bring?</strong> </h3>
    <p> most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
        changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to
        bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure! </p>
